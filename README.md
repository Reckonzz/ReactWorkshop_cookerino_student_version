# Setup Guide 
Hi! We are excited to give you the full stack web developer experience, but before we start off, we need to ensure that all the needed software is downloaded 

## Django (7th January 3pm-6pm)
### Installing anaconda 
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

## React (8th January 3pm-6pm)
We have to install nodejs to start developing React apps, lets go! 

### Installing Nodejs 
To install Nodejs, you can use the link below and click the option depending on your computer system 

https://nodejs.org/en/ (Windows and MacOS)

For homebrew users (macOS)
- Brew Install node 

To check if it is installed properly 
- Open your terminal (macOS) or command prompt (windows )
- run: npm --version or node --version 
- npm version 6.14.10 or node version 14.15.4 respectively. (Any later version will work fine)

### Installing Visual Studio Code 
If you have already been coding and have your favourite code editor then feel free to use your preferred code editor of choice!

However, if you want some swag, download Visual Studio Code to help you write some awesome code :)

You can download it in the link below and choose the option based on your computer system 
https://code.visualstudio.com/download

### Checking if you can run React 
This is to check if everything is installed properly and functioning, if this works for you you are good to go for the workshop on friday :)

1. Go to any folder you want to save your file in 
2. navigate to that file path in your command prompt or terminal and run npx create-react-app first-react-app (This will usually take a while to complete)
3. cd into that folder using cd first-react-app 
4. run npm start 
5. The browser should automatically open up but if it doesn't, go to localhost:3000 in your browser. If you see a spinning react icon youre good to go!

### Wrap up 
You have learnt to create your very first react app! 
Look forward to teaching you more on friday!
